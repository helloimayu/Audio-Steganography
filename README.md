# Audio-Steganography
The main objective of this project is to design, implement and test audio steganography techniques in a network. The system will use LSB techniques for embedding secret data in audio. Then this audio with secret data will be transferres over a network. The goal of stenography is to hide the data from a third party through the process of transmission and also at the receiving end, allowing both the parties to keep a check on security.
